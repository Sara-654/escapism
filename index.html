        <h1>What is Escapism?</h1>
        <p>
          <span class="names">ESCAPISM</span> , Escapism is the tendency to withdraw from the world into daydreams or entertainment.
          When life gets difficult, escapism gives people a way to take a break from reality. A person's escapism might consist of playing video games,
           reading books, or fantasizing about living in a foreign country. Some see escapism as negative,
           hiding an underlying sadness or depression, while others insist that everyone indulges in escapism to some extent.
          <br />
          <br />
          <span class="names">ESCAPISM</span> “In psychology, escapism is generally defined as a desire or behavior to ignore, evade, or avoid reality,” 
          says Dr. Carla Marie Manly, a clinical psychologist based in California. “During traumatic experiences, many individuals naturally ‘escape’ the
           situation mentally in order to avoid further distress and psychological harm.”<br>

          <br><h1>SOME FAMOUS TECHNOLOGIES</h1>  </br></br>
          <p>
            Virutal Reality(VR),Augmented Reality(AR),Metaverse,BackRooms etc are some technogies invented to escape from the reality.
          </p>
          <p>The most famous of all is Virutal Reality which was invented by <i>Jaron Laniers</i> in mid-1980s.
            Also the first AR technology was developed in 1968 at Harvard by famous computer scientist <i>Ivan Sutherland.</i>
            He is also known as named the “father of computer graphics”.He created an AR head-mounted display system.

        <h1>BRIEF DESCRIPTION</h1>
        <p>
          There are many ways by which we can escapse the reality,some technogies helped to do so.
          The brief description is provied:

          <br />
          <br />
          <ul class="technogies">
              <li>
              <h1>VIRTUAL REALITY</h1><p>
                The computer-generated simulation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or 
                physical way by a person using special electronic equipment, such as a helmet with a screen inside or gloves fitted with sensors.
              </p> </li>
              <br> 
              <li>
                <h1>AUGMENTED REALITY</h1><p>
                  A technology that superimposes a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view.
                  AR users experience a real-world environment with generated perceptual information overlaid on top of it.
                </p></li></br><br>

              <li>
                <h1>BACKROOMS</h1><p>
                  They are a space that exists outside of reality and, as a result, they do not behave the way we usually expect spaces to behave. 
                  They go on forever. They loop. They twist. They turn.
                  They double back on themselves. They relocate. And they do all sorts of other things that, to our minds, they should not.
                </p></li></br><br>
              <li>
                <h1>METAVERSE</h1><p>
                  “The term Metaverse is used to describe a combination of the virtual reality and mixed reality worlds accessed through a browser or 
                  headset, which allows people to have real time interactions and experiences across distance."
                </p></li></br>
